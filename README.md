# Bloxorz-Graph-Project

Boxorz video game made in C with graphs using Adjacency Matrix(3 adjacency matrices). 
Biggest challenge was because graph had to be represented with Adjacency matrix and        
because there can be a couple of different states of a player(block) graph was implemented via 3 adjecency matrices.
